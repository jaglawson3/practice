  <h1>Cities I have lived in</h1>

  <p>I was born in Omaha, lived most of my formative years in Bellevue.
    Then I moved to Ames for undergrad, then moved to Thronton after graduation.
    Forget to mention I also lived in Rome for a time during undergrad.
    Then from THronton to Boulder for grad school, then lafayette and now to my current
    home in Broomfield.</p>
